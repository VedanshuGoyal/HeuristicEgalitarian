# HeuristicEgalitarian

The HeuristicEgalitarian project aims to tackle the Stable Matching Problem by minimizing the egalitarian score using heuristic algorithms such as Hill Climb and Genetic Algorithm.

## Problem Description

The Stable Matching Problem involves finding a stable matching between two sets of elements, typically referred to as "men" and "women." The objective is to create pairs where there are no two elements from different sets who both prefer each other over their current partners.

## Egalitarian Score

The Egalitarian Score is used as a metric to measure the level of equality or fairness in the matching. By minimizing the egalitarian score, we aim to achieve a more balanced distribution of elements among the sets, promoting fairness in the final matching.

## Heuristic Algorithms

The HeuristicEgalitarian project utilizes two heuristic algorithms:

1. Hill Climb
2. Genetic Algorithm
